        <p><div id="subheading">CONTRACT AND LEASE REVIEW:</div>
          Many  businesses  and  individuals  make  the  critical  mistake  of signing  documents  without  reading
          them  thoroughly.    Often  those  that  do  carefully  read documents prior to execution, do not understand
          all the legal ramifications arising out of the language contained in a contract or other binding document.
          The very best use of a lawyer is before  a  legal  problem  arises.    Attorney  fees  for  consultation
          and  advise  prior  to  contract execution is exponentially smaller than fees associated with resolving
          litigation arising out of a breach of contract claim. Our firm can provide opinion letters and sage advise
          regarding the ramifications of the language contained in any contract whether it is a lease, insurance policy
          and other contract.<br></br>

          <div id="subheading">CONTRACT AND LEASE DRAFTING:</div>The  corollary  of  contract  review  if  contract  drafting.  Often  the
          party who  drafts  the  contract is  the  one receiving the  benefit of better terms  and conditions. Our
          firm  can  prepare  contracts  for  business  acquisitions,  property  purchases  and  leases arrangements.<br></br>

          <div id="subheading">BREACH OF CONTRACT, BUSINESS TORT, AND REAL ESTATE LITIGATION:</div> If,  in  the  unfortunate  event,
          litigation becomes  inevitable our firm has  more than 20 years litigation experience. We take great  care  to
          insure  our  clients  are  given  the  best  representation  possible  by  insuring  that thorough  legal
          research and  vigorous  motion practice  back  our clientâ€™s  positions before any court of law.<br></br>

          <div id="subheading">BUSINESS INCORPORATION AND FORMATION:</div> Our firm has more than 20  years experience forming limited
          liability  companies,C-  Corporations,  S-Corporations  and not  for  profit  entities.  We carefully
          advise  our  clients  as  to  the  best  business  entity  to  utilize  to  meet  their  needs  and then
          proceed  to  prepare  the  necessary documents  and  file  them with  the  appropriate governmental entity
          to ensure limited liability.<br></br>

          <div id="subheading">STRATEGIC BUSINESS CONSULTING:</div>  Our firm has more than 25 years business
          experience forming, growing   and   maintaining   successful   businesses.   This   experience   allows
          our   staff   to emphasize with small business owners in need of good legal guidance.
          Often lawyers do not understand  the  challenges  faced  by  entrepreneurs.
          Our  staff  does  because  our  lawyers  are also  entrepreneurs  and  they  fully  understand  the
          demands  and  challenges  of  starting  and growing a business.
