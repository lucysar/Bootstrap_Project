     <h3>CONTRACT AND LEASE REVIEW</h3>
     <p>Many  businesses  and  individuals  make  the  critical  mistake  of signing  documents  without  reading
     them  thoroughly.    Often  those  that  do  carefully  read documents prior to execution, do not understand
     all the legal ramifications arising out of the language contained in a contract or other binding document.
     The very best use of a lawyer is before  a  legal  problem  arises.    Attorney  fees  for  consultation
     and  advise  prior  to  contract execution is exponentially smaller than fees associated with resolving
     litigation arising out of a breach of contract claim. Our firm can provide opinion letters and sage advise
     regarding the ramifications of the language contained in any contract whether it is a lease, insurance policy
     and other contract.</p>
